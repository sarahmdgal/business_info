# business_info
Sample code in PHP and MySQL for Business Customer Information System
These are working sample files in PHP, all written from scratch.  In the business_info folder is a sample MySQL database titled business_info which can be imported into MySQL 5.7 or later.  User Name is 'staffmember', and Password is 'Customer1'.
Also the same sample database has been connected to Python 3.7 screens.  The primary file, BusinessCustomerInformationScreenMySQLPython37.py is the screen to run.  BusinessCustomer.py is the class file, and db_businesscustomer.py is the connecting file to the MySQL database.

NOTE:  Everything was tested using wampserver64, with localhost.
